## flatfiledb

This is a quick and dirty implementation of a flat file database. Its features include an import program and a query program. The import program takes a pipe separated file to import, and must containcorrectly formatted data. The query program will run queries on the db and return matched items.

This is meant to be a coding excercise, not an actual implementation for real world use.
